# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

I used the provided Backpack library as well as my own css for styling the frontend. Backpack provided many components such as cards and icons that were useful in keeping the design of the Skyscanner app consistent. This allowed for a unified design rather than using multiple libraries. 

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

(Default) `npm start`

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

I noticed that each flight had a date as well as an agent rating. With more time, a sorting or filtering button to perform these actions based on rating and date would have been neat to see. 

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

I'm most proud of my design and use of components. Each component heavily uses flexbox, which is easier for me to visualize and understand how and where components fit. There maybe more efficient techniques, but this was the simplest and most feasible in my eyes given the time constraints.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

First off, understanding the environment was the most difficult. The solution itself, the act of coming up with a readable and aesthetically pleasing way to display flights was easy compared to understanding the environment. Going through all the files and understanding what was given to me and what route I should take in starting proved to be more time consuming than implementing certain components.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

I found the test enjoyable. Having to understand some unfamiliar technologies, then using those technologies to create a working app is rewarding. The only issues I've run into developing this app is some of the documentation for the Backpack framework is unclear, leading me to look into the `node_modules` folder for how to implement some components.
